## _Installation_

Type `npm i (or install)`, in terminal, which will install the required node_modules (in this case inquirer and jest pkgs) package dependencies folder in directory. Once that is done, head over to the usage section below...

## _Usage_

After the above steps are taken care of, run `npm test` in terminal to initiate Jest npm for code testing (and it works as intended!!), and then, run`node index.js` in terminal to initiate inquirer prompts. Answer a list of questions as per required to generate the file (prompts work and show appropriately in console logs but the final html file generated is all borked up and unsatisfactory, and at this point after googling around, asking help from ppl trying thing around i have no clue what more to do...). Once that is done, a `success` statement will pop up in terminal and a file will be saved in the directory.

## _Credits_

Used `Inquirer` and `Jest` official npm sites for their documentations to help with the coding. </br> Used [dev.to](https://dev.to/envoy_/150-badges-for-github-pnk#ide) link for some `badges`. </br> Searched solutions on `Google&YouTube`. </br> _**Asked 2/3 people for help with the assignment and for the most part they were mighty helpful. But, Alas!, we still could not get the satisfactory final result no matter what... :( , which is still borked up. I will keep on revisiting and re-trying to make it work and then re-update this repo and the submission as well.**_
